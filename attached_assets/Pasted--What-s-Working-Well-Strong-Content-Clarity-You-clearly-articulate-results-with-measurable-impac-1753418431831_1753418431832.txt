✅ What’s Working Well
Strong Content & Clarity

You clearly articulate results with measurable impacts (e.g., "Improved ticket resolution time by 25%", "Maintained 3.94 GPA while working full-time").

Each position has a well-structured mix of responsibilities and accomplishments.

Quantification is consistent (team size, SLA %, tape count, GPA, uptime).

Logical Grouping

You’ve separated experience into role descriptions and major accomplishments.

Educational experience is properly listed with applied projects and recognitions.

Solid Hierarchy of Roles

Most recent to oldest: clear progression from technician to leadership roles.

❌ Replit Visual Issues & Fixes
1. Too Much White Space and Fragmentation
Issue: Major accomplishments are floating in separate boxes next to or below the job card, making scanning difficult.

Fix: Integrate “Major Accomplishments” directly inside each job card under the bullet list using a bold subheading.

2. Split Columns Hurt Readability
Issue: Your experience is split across horizontal and vertical columns. This forces eye zig-zagging.

Fix: Use a single-column layout on Replit for mobile-friendly clarity. Stack job title → bullets → accomplishments.

3. Icon & Metric Overload
Issue: System Analyst role uses too many numerical stats (e.g., 24/7, 100%, 18.75 years) as if it's a dashboard.

Fix: Replace metrics section with one bold accomplishment line or embed data into bullets (e.g., "Led a 12-person team across 3 states with 100% SLA compliance").

4. Inconsistent Card Width and Alignment
Issue: Some boxes are aligned left, some right, some center. On Replit, this causes erratic scrolling and layout breaks.

Fix: Force uniform width (max-width: 800px), and align all cards center on page with margin: auto.

🔧 Style/Content Adjustments Suggested
✅ “IT Technician – Olympic College”

✅ “Bachelor of Applied Science Student”
Recommendation: Move “Maintained 3.94 GPA…” to accomplishments below, not in the paragraph body.

✅ “Operations Lead – Dell Technologies”
Recommendation: Combine a few similar bullets:

✅ Final Verdict
Your content is excellent. You show clear results, progression, and leadership. What’s hurting the look is:

Layout fragmentation

Data-heavy formatting (numbers and icons)

Unbalanced columns and excessive whitespace
