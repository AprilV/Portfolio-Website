🔷 OVERALL LAYOUT
Strengths:

Clean vertical timeline with modern card design

Consistent format (title, org, date/location, summary, bullet points)

Icons, color, and spacing are polished and professional

Timeline indicator ("Experience") stands out in blue – nice visual anchor

Weaknesses:

Section is visually long. With 3–4 roles, it may scroll too far on a laptop screen. Consider:

Slightly reducing paragraph spacing

Putting each job card on its own page/slide (Replit site may need pagination logic for print/export)

🔹 POSITION 1: IT Technician – Olympic College
Strengths:

Clear time/location

Strong summary line: “Provided comprehensive IT support across campus systems…”

Good verb variety (“Supported,” “Troubleshooting,” “Configuration,” “Documentation”)

Suggestions:

Add scale: how many users supported? Campus size?

Replace "educational environment" with more concrete detail if possible (e.g. “multi-building campus IT network”)

Suggested revision to final bullet:

Authored technical documentation and contributed to internal IT knowledge base for improved service continuity.

🔹 POSITION 2: Team Lead – Dell Technologies (Jewish Hospital / UofL / others)
Strengths:

Role progression is clear (Team Lead following Systems Analyst)

Emphasizes leadership, coaching, and escalated support

Bullet points begin strong with verbs: "Led," "Trained," "Improved," "Oversaw"

Suggestions:

Clarify organization: Some confusion between Dell, Jewish Hospital, and CHI. It currently reads like a blend. Suggested:

Dell Technologies (Contracted to CHI/Jewish Hospital & UofL Health)

On endpoint count: you said 500+ may be low. Based on your deployments across multiple hospitals, a conservative but credible number would be ~1,500 endpoints.

Suggested bullet edit:

Oversaw endpoint management for 1,500+ devices across regional hospital systems, ensuring uptime and rapid incident response.

🔹 POSITION 3: Systems Analyst / Operations Technician – Dell Technologies
Strengths:

Good use of dual title

Highlights technical tools (Active Directory, Exchange, SCCM)

Strong mention of data center collaboration

Suggestions:

Break the large paragraph into summary + 4 bullets

Suggested bullet refactor:

Diagnosed enterprise-level system outages and restored services under strict SLAs

Created custom PowerShell scripts for patch automation and system health reporting

Supported Tier 3 escalations across Active Directory, Exchange, and Windows environments

Coordinated closely with Dell's remote data center teams to escalate critical incidents

🔹 POSITION ORDER & DATES
GOOD:

Reverse-chronological order is correct.

Consistent date formatting.

Brief city/state adds location context without clutter.

🔸 ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Consider renaming this section from “Professional Experience” to “Professional Experience & Leadership” to match the portfolio theme

You might add total years inline (e.g. “18+ years of experience in IT Operations, Systems Analysis, and Technical Leadership” in the intro banner)

✅ CONCLUSION
Your Professional Experience section is strong but can be tightened for clarity and maximum hiring impact. Your experience shows excellent seniority and cross-industry range.
