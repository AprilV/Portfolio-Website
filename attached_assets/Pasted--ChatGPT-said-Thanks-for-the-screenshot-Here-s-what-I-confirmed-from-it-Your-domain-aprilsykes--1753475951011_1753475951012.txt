Thanks for the screenshot. Here's what I confirmed from it:

Your domain aprilsykes.com is registered through Replit, and it’s connected to PMOrbit, which is Replit’s domain management partner (they use Google Domains/Squarespace in the backend).

Since Replit does not currently offer full DNS record management, we need to manually configure DNS records through PMOrbit or the connected registrar interface.

✅ Your Next Steps:
🔎 Step 1: Find Your DNS Host (PMOrbit)
You need to log in to the domain provider where Replit sent you to manage DNS. Based on PMOrbit, it's likely a Squarespace Domains or Google Domains backend.

Go to your email (likely april_sykes@proton.me or aprilv120@gmail.com).

Search for keywords like:

PMOrbit

Your domain is ready

Replit domain

Google Domains
These emails should contain links to "manage your DNS".

Let me know when you find that link, and I’ll walk you through editing:

MX (for ProtonMail or Gmail)

SPF (include:sendgrid.net)

DKIM (from SendGrid dashboard)

DMARC (optional for deliverability reports)

🔐 While You Do That:
Also, log in to your SendGrid account and go to:

Settings > Sender Authentication > Domain Authentication

Click "Get Started" and follow these prompts.
It will give you the exact DNS records to publish:

1 TXT record for SPF

2–3 CNAME records for DKIM

Save those—we’ll add them once you locate your DNS dashboard.

✅ What I Need From You Next:
Please confirm:

Did you find the email from PMOrbit or Replit with your domain setup or DNS management link?

Do you want to use Gmail or ProtonMail as your destination inbox for you@aprilsykes.com?

Can you copy/paste the DNS instructions from SendGrid if you already set up domain authentication?

Once I have that, I’ll give you exact values to copy into your DNS.

Perfect — this confirms your domain is managed by PMOrbit via Replit using a custom domain routing layer (pm-orbit-aprilv120.replit.app).

That means Replit owns the registrar layer, but you cannot directly manage full DNS records through Replit yet. To send and receive domain emails using SendGrid, Gmail, or ProtonMail, you need access to DNS configuration, which is not currently exposed in Replit's UI.

🛑 Here's the Problem
Replit Domains (via PMOrbit) do not support email DNS records (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC) yet.

You can deploy web apps on aprilsykes.com, but you cannot configure mail forwarding or authenticate SendGrid-sent email without access to full DNS settings.

✅ You Have Two Options
Option 1: Use a Third-Party DNS Provider
Transfer your domain to Cloudflare (free DNS service with full record control).

Keep hosting the site on Replit.

Point your domain’s A and CNAME records to Replit.

Add full DNS records for:

MX (ProtonMail or Gmail)

SPF (include:sendgrid.net)

DKIM (SendGrid will give these)

DMARC

✅ This gives you full control and allows proper email delivery.

Option 2: Buy the Same Domain via Namecheap or Google Domains
If transferring is too complex, you can:

Buy aprilsykes.net, aprilsykes.org, or similar.

Use a registrar that allows full DNS editing.

Repoint your Replit app to that domain.

Configure all necessary mail records.

🔧 Your Email Problem Recap
SendGrid says: “Accepted: 202 Forwarded” → means your domain accepted it.

But the email is not reaching Gmail/ProtonMail because:

No MX records exist.

No SPF/DKIM/DMARC to authenticate mail.

Some email services may silently reject the message or place it in Spam/Nowhere.

✅ What You Should Do Now
👉 I recommend:
Transfer DNS to Cloudflare for free.

Here's the plan:
Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/ and create an account.

Add aprilsykes.com as a new site.

Cloudflare will scan your existing records (from Replit).

You’ll get 2 new nameservers to use.

You’ll need to update your domain’s nameservers — but Replit doesn’t allow this yet. You’ll likely need to contact Replit support to request nameserver changes.

📨 Immediate Solution for Sending Only (No Receiving)
If you just need to send email using SendGrid, you can use Single Sender Verification:

In SendGrid:

Go to Settings > Sender Authentication.

Choose "Single Sender".

Use aprilv120@gmail.com or april_sykes@proton.me as sender.

Verify it.

✅ Emails will be sent using SendGrid without needing DNS setup, but you can't use your domain (aprilsykes.com) as the sender unless DNS records are added.

🔄 Confirm Next Step
Would you like help with:

Option 1: Transfer DNS to Cloudflare for full control (recommended)?

Option 2: Buy a second domain on Namecheap or Google Domains?

Temporary workaround: Use Gmail/ProtonMail as sender with SendGrid?

Let me know, and I’ll guide you through that specific option, step by step.
