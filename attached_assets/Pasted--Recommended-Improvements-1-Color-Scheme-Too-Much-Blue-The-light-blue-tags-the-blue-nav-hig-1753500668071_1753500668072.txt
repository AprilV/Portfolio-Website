⚠️ Recommended Improvements
1. Color Scheme
⚠️ Too Much Blue:

The light blue tags, the blue nav highlight, and the icon accents are all shades of blue.

This results in low contrast between tags and the background in some places.

✅ Suggestion:

Keep one column blue-themed, and use a complementary accent (e.g., teal, orange, or green) for the other.

Example: Project Management → teal; Technical Foundation → blue.

⚠️ “Academic” tags in light blue feel under-emphasized. They could be bordered or bolder to stand out more.

2. Tag Visual Hierarchy
⚠️ Tags like “In Progress”, “Academic”, and “20+ Years + Academic” should be color-coded by status:

“In Progress” = yellow ✅ (good)

“Academic” = too soft — make darker blue or bordered

“20+ Years + Academic” = consider a gradient or multi-tone tag to visually encode dual status

3. Hover or Interactivity
❌ Currently static.
✅ Suggestion: Add hover effects (slight lift or color shift) to each skill box. This improves mobile responsiveness and gives a more polished UI feel.

4. Section Title/Header
⚠️ “Skills & Competencies” heading is a bit small compared to the richness of the section content.
✅ Suggest slightly larger font size and using a dual-tone underline like:

css
Copy
Edit
Skills & <strong>Competencies</strong>
5. Mobile Responsiveness
⚠️ You’ll need to verify the two-column layout collapses cleanly on tablet and mobile screens.
✅ Each card (PM Core and Tech Foundation) should become full-width and stack vertically.

✅ Optional Enhancements
🎯 Add icons to each skill row to visually distinguish categories (e.g., laptop for tech support, globe for network).

🧠 Tooltips or popovers for tags like “Academic” could show what course earned it.

🟨 Highlight 1–2 skills with special icons or star badge if they're key to your career objective (e.g., PM II or Server Support).

⭐ Final Evaluation
Category	Score / 10	Notes
Layout	9.5	Clear, elegant, modular
Typography	9	Excellent spacing and clarity
Color Palette	7.5	Too blue-heavy; lacks distinction between badges
UX/Responsiveness	7	Needs hover states and mobile check
Visual Impact	8	Clean, but could benefit from color or icon accents
