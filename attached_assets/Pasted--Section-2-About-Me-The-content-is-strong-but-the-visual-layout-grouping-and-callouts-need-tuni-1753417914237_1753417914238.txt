 Section 2: About Me. The content is strong, but the visual layout, grouping, and callouts need tuning to prevent visual fatigue and improve clarity.

✅ SECTION: About Me
🔍 Visual Assessment:
Clear intro and academic/professional summary.

Right-side stat boxes are clean but float without strong alignment.

Core Values box is unanchored and underemphasized.

Feels crowded and left-heavy — especially on wider screens.

There’s no clear hierarchy between paragraphs.

1. RESTRUCTURE LAYOUT INTO TWO DISTINCT COLUMNS
   - Left: Content block (bio, education, experience).
   - Right: Fixed-height stat cards in a vertical stack, centered and evenly spaced.

2. ADD VISUAL HEADINGS OR SUBHEADS
   - Before the second and third paragraph, insert headings:
     - "Academic Background"
     - "Professional Experience"
   - Use <h3> styling or strong font-weight, not <p>.

3. TIGHTEN VERTICAL SPACING
   - Reduce line spacing between paragraphs and stat blocks by 20%.
   - Add consistent margin-bottom between each text block.

4. INTEGRATE 'CORE VALUES' BOX INTO MAIN FLOW
   - Move Core Values card to the **bottom of left column** instead of floating in the right.
   - Alternately, place it under the stat cards but style it with a distinct title and light border.

5. STYLE UPDATES FOR STAT CARDS
   - Add subtle hover scale or highlight on stats (lift effect on hover).
   - Use consistent padding, min height, and align text baseline inside each card.
   - Set max width for cards on mobile to avoid cramping.

6. ACCESSIBILITY + CLARITY
   - Add `aria-label` or tooltip to “100% SLA Compliance” to explain what this means.
✅ Suggested Enhancements:
Issue	Fix
Too text-heavy	Add subtle icons to stat cards (e.g., user group for "12 Team Members Led")
No visual anchor	Use a horizontal divider between intro and bullet-pointed values
Weak text hierarchy	Use bold or dark-blue for major entities (e.g., Olympic College, Jewish Hospital)

About Section Cleanup Tasks:

1. Convert About section to a responsive 2-column layout:
   - Left: Paragraphs (Bio, Academic, Experience)
   - Right: Vertical stack of stat cards (Years, GPA, Team Size, SLA)

2. Add subheadings ("Academic Background", "Professional Experience") in bold above relevant paragraphs for scannability.

3. Move Core Values card below main content and restyle it as a standard section box, not floating.

4. Add slight hover effects on stat cards. Ensure all cards are same width/height with consistent padding.

5. Improve visual spacing on large screens. Reduce clutter, avoid floating elements, and align text + cards better.

6. Add screen reader labels or tooltips to clarify what "SLA Compliance" means.
