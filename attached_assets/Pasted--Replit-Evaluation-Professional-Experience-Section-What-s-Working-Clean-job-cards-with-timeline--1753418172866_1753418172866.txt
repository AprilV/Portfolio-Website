 Replit Evaluation: Professional Experience Section
✅ What’s Working:
Clean job cards with timeline headers.

Role titles are bold and clear.

Responsibilities are broken into bullets.

Font hierarchy is readable.

Background and spacing are consistent with the rest of the site.

🔴 Problems Identified (UI + UX + Content):
1. Layout Weaknesses
Cards are too tall vertically — forcing scroll fatigue.

Section lacks visual grouping or a clear chronological flow.

No way to quickly scan company names, years, or roles.

2. Missing Visual Anchors
No company logos, section divider lines, or career progression indicators.

Lacks interactivity (no hover or animation effects).

3. No Highlights or Achievements Called Out
All bullets are same style — makes it difficult to tell which accomplishments were standout.

No quantitative metrics are visually emphasized (e.g., reduced ticket resolution time by 30%).

4. No Tech Stack or Skills Integration
Skills used per job are buried in the paragraph instead of shown in a quick-scan format.

You’ve already listed strong platforms (e.g., Cisco, Linux, Perot’s systems), but they’re not highlighted.

✅ Replit Developer Instructions
🔧 OVERHAUL THE SECTION FOR PROFESSIONAL CREDIBILITY
1. 🧱 Wrap the Entire Experience Section in a Unified Container
Use a 2-column flex grid to show:

Left = Logo + Years + Role Title + Location

Right = Bullets + Achievements + Stack Chips

2. 💼 Card Redesign Layout (React JSX)
Here’s the structure to follow for each job:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="experience-card">
  <div className="experience-header">
    <img src="/logos/dell.png" alt="Dell Technologies Logo" className="company-logo" />
    <div>
      <h3>Dell Technologies</h3>
      <p className="job-title">Infrastructure Services Lead</p>
      <p className="job-dates">2008 – 2011 | Louisville, KY</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <ul className="responsibilities">
    <li>Managed data center support and team leadership for regional clients.</li>
    <li><span className="highlight">Reduced outage response time by 40%</span> using proactive ticket management.</li>
    <li>Supported mainframes, Cisco networks, and Linux systems across transitions.</li>
  </ul>

  <div className="tech-stack">
    <span>Cisco</span><span>Linux</span><span>ServiceNow</span><span>Mainframes</span>
  </div>
</div>
