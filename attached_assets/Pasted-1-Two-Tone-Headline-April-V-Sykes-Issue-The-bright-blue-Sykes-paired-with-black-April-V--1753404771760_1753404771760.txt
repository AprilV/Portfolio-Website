1. ❌ Two-Tone Headline ("April V. Sykes")
Issue: The bright blue "Sykes" paired with black "April V." makes your name feel disjointed or brand-inconsistent.

Why it matters: This is your professional brand. Split-tone headings tend to look trendy but not authoritative.

Fix Options:

Option A (Best): Use a single deep navy or charcoal for the full name: #1E1E1E or #1A3C64

Option B: Use a subtle bold + semibold contrast, not color: April V. Sykes (same color, different weight)

Recommendation: Unify it. Color contrast here adds no benefit and breaks polish.

2. ✅ Hero Section Structure
This section is well-spaced and visually clean.

Badges (CAPM, BAS-IS, Experience) are great, readable, and nicely styled.

Buttons are sharp now—with hover, depth, and spacing.

✅ No further changes needed.

3. ⚠️ About Me Section – Color & Depth
Current background: Very light gray #F9FAFB, but there's no contrast between the card elements and section background.

Fix: Slightly darken the section background to #F2F4F8 OR add a subtle box-shadow to content cards:

css
Copy
Edit
box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);
Also, consider using bolder section headers (e.g. “About Me”, “Professional Experience”)—you can increase size or add color anchors to section dividers (like a short underline or color bar) without going full multi-tone.

4. ⚠️ Certifications Section
Issue: The icons (shields, documents, badges) are great, but the section feels sterile. It’s a wall of white cards.

Fix Suggestions:

Add a very light background tint to each row or card: #F4F7FA or #F9FAFC.

Slight inner shadow or border: 1px solid #E0E6ED.

Reduce padding between badges so the section doesn’t stretch so vertically.

5. ✅ Contact / Let’s Connect Section
Layout is excellent. Spacing, readability, and icons are strong.

You have clear call-to-action, status labels, and clean form design.

Font hierarchy works well.

✅ No changes required.

6. ⚠️ Overall Color Cohesion
Your current blues, greens, and grays look fine individually, but they need slight unification across headings, icons, and badges.

Element	Current	Suggested Fix
Primary Headings	Mix of black + bright blue	Use consistent navy/charcoal
Badge Fills	Bright green/blue	Slightly desaturate or standardize
Section Headers	Underlines vary	Use 1 consistent underline accent (#2C73D2 or #43D8C9) for all

🔧 Final Recommendations
Fix Priority	Action
🔵 High	Make all section headers single-color (drop two-tone name)
🟢 Medium	Slightly darken backgrounds or add contrast to cards (certifications, skills)
🟡 Low	Standardize all badge colors and spacing
🔵 Optional	Add section anchor bars or underline accents to highlight transitions
