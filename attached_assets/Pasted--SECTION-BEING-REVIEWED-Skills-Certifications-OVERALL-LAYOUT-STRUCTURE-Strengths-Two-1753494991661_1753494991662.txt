🔎 SECTION BEING REVIEWED:
“Skills & Certifications”

✅ OVERALL LAYOUT & STRUCTURE
✔️ Strengths:
Two-Column Grid: Great split between Project Management Core and Technical Foundation. Maintains clarity and avoids overload.

Consistent Badge Usage: Clean pill-shaped badges (blue, gray, black) communicate role/experience type (e.g., Academic, 20+ Years).

Certifications Below: Well-separated visually. Each entry is clearly labeled, with icon, title, credential link, and description.

⚠️ Suggestions:
Padding Between Cards (Desktop): Slightly tight vertically. Add ~16–24px more padding between certification cards.

Column Collapse (Mobile): Cards may stack too closely on small screens. Ensure enough vertical spacing + center alignment on collapse.

🎨 COLOR SCHEME
✔️ Strengths:
Professional Neutrals: White background, navy header, soft shadows = clean and modern.

Blue Call-to-Actions (CTA): Hyperlinks and badges are styled in bright accessible blue – matches theme well.

Contrast: Good contrast between body text, titles, and badges.

⚠️ Suggestions:
Badge Color Overlap: Some badge colors (black/gray) look too similar. Consider:

Blue for “Academic”

Dark Gray for “Professional Experience”

Teal for “In Progress” or “Candidate”

Cert Card Borders: Add very light border (#f0f0f0) to separate cards slightly more from background. The shadow alone is subtle.

🧭 NAVIGATION / INTERACTION
✔️ Strengths:
Back to Top Arrow: Present, styled correctly, fixed position. Useful given scroll length.

Clickable Credential Links: Clear and consistently marked. Easy to locate.

Consistent Headings/Subheadings: Follows visual hierarchy.

⚠️ Suggestions:
Section Anchor Link: Consider adding an anchor to this section (e.g., #skills) and link to it from nav.

Hide Icons on Mobile: As you scroll down on mobile, icons (especially header ones) can take up space. Hide them or scale them smaller.

🖼️ ICONS & VISUAL ELEMENTS
✔️ Strengths:
Icons are now all Font Awesome, consistently placed.

Grayscale/single-tone is used for most — no clash with theme.

⚠️ Suggestions:
Cert Icons (fa-certificate, fa-code):

Consider left-aligning icons in line with title, or vertically centering within card top.

Make sure all are 32x32px for uniformity.

📱 RESPONSIVENESS (Mobile/Tablet)
✔️ Strengths:
Section appears to be responsive.

Cards collapse as expected into vertical stack.

⚠️ Suggestions:
Touch Padding: Increase touch area for small links (e.g., “Verify Credential” buttons).

Badge Clarity: On mobile, make sure badges wrap correctly and aren’t cut off.
