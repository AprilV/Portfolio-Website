✅ SECTION: Hero / Header Panel (Top of Page)
🔍 Visual Assessment:
Name, title, tagline, and GPA are clearly shown.

Nice use of highlight badges (CAPM, BAS-IS Student, experience).

Strong, professional photo with GPA tag.

Good CTA buttons.

🔧 Replit Task Instructions:
🔹Target Component: Hero / Header Section
🔹File Likely Affected: Hero.jsx or Header.jsx

📌 Summary of Fixes to Make Now:
Add motion/animation to CTA buttons:

Add a subtle hover lift and shadow effect to both buttons (Get in Touch, Download Resume).

Consider a fade-in or slide-in animation on load for these elements.

Improve mobile responsiveness:

Ensure GPA badge on profile photo scales or moves below photo at narrow widths.

Reduce font size slightly on long title lines on mobile.

Refine tag styling:

Space out the badges horizontally and vertically with consistent padding and line-height.

Add hover tooltips:

"CAPM Candidate 2025" → "Preparing for Certified Associate in Project Management exam"

"20+ Years IT Experience" → "Legacy systems, infrastructure, and enterprise support"

Make GPA badge clickable:

Link to Academic Achievements section or a modal popup showing GPA history / President’s List details.

Fix alignment on large screens:

Align image + text block better for ultrawide viewports. Currently too much empty right space on desktop >1400px.

✅ Suggested Enhancements (Optional but Polished):
Feature	Description
🎥 Subtle intro animation	Slide or fade the profile photo and text in from opposite directions on page load
💡 Tooltip rollovers	Add info boxes for badges on hover to explain experience
🔗 Resume button tracking	Integrate a click event or counter for how many times it’s downloaded
🧠 Accessibility	Ensure GPA badge is aria-labeled for screen readers

4. Make GPA badge clickable and optionally open a modal showing GPA history or awards.
5. Center content better on wide screens. Too much empty space right of the profil
