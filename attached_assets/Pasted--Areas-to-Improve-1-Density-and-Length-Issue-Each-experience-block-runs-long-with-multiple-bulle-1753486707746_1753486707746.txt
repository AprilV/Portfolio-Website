❗️Areas to Improve:
1. Density and Length
Issue: Each experience block runs long with multiple bullets, which risks reader fatigue—especially for hiring managers.

Fix: Limit bullet points to 4–5 per job. Focus on results and quantifiables.

✅ What to keep: high-impact, numbers-based bullets (e.g., "Supported 1,200+ endpoint devices...")

🛑 What to cut: low-differentiating bullets like “assisted with patching” (unless tied to a security outcome).

2. Consistency of Format
Issue: Some bullets start with verbs (e.g., "Managed..."), others start with nouns (e.g., “Technical support for...”).

Fix: Use consistent verb-based bullet starts for uniform style.

3. Results-Oriented Language
Issue: Some achievements are written as tasks, not outcomes.

e.g., “Technical documentation and knowledge base contributions” is vague.

Fix: Add results or scope:

“Created technical documentation adopted across 3 departments to reduce support call volume.”

4. Redundant Skills Across Roles
Issue: Several roles repeat bullets like "technical support" or "documentation."

Fix: Collapse or differentiate these—show how your scope evolved (e.g., from "hands-on repair" to "technical escalation point").

5. Visual Hierarchy for Section Headers
Issue: The section title “Professional Experience” blends in with the timeline.

Fix: Add top spacing, or accent bar (like the “Experience” bubble) to give it more visual weight. Might also consider icons or a subheading like:

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Selected Roles Demonstrating IT & Leadership Growth

6. Quantify the Large-Scale IT Work (Updated)
You said: Your work covered multiple facilities and more than 500 endpoints. We can now estimate ~2,000+ endpoints across regions.

Suggested bullet improvement:

Oversaw Tier 2 support and endpoint management for ~2,000+ devices across Jewish Hospital, UofL, and affiliated regional healthcare facilities.

🔧 Suggested Action Items:
Change Type	Suggestion
✂ Reduce	Limit each role to 4–5 bullets. Remove generic statements.
🔁 Standardize	Begin all bullets with verbs. Maintain parallel structure.
📊 Add Metrics	Add quantified scope/results in each bullet (e.g., “Reduced downtime 32%...”).
🎯 Differentiate Roles	Show growth: junior tech → team lead → operations oversight.
🎨 Improve Visuals	Add more whitespace or color header to the section title for clarity.
