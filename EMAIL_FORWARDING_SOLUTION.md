# Simple Email Forwarding Solution for april@aprilsykes.com

## The Solution: Domain Registrar Email Forwarding

Since Replit doesn't support MX records, we'll use email forwarding through your domain registrar.

## Step 1: Find Your Domain Registrar

Your domain aprilsykes.com was originally purchased from a registrar. Common ones:
- Namecheap
- GoDaddy  
- Google Domains
- Porkbun
- Dynadot

To find yours, check:
1. Your email receipts for domain purchase
2. Run: `whois aprilsykes.com` to see registrar info

## Step 2: Set Up Email Forwarding

Most registrars offer email forwarding even when DNS is hosted elsewhere:

### At Your Registrar:
1. Log into your domain registrar account
2. Go to Email/Email Forwarding section
3. Create forwarding rule:
   - From: april@aprilsykes.com
   - To: your-protonmail@protonmail.com

### Cost:
- Usually FREE with domain registration
- Some charge $1-5/month for email forwarding

## Step 3: Update Your Portfolio

Once forwarding works, update your contact information to show april@aprilsykes.com as your professional email.

## Benefits:
- Keep website hosting on Replit (no changes needed)
- Get professional email address april@aprilsykes.com
- Emails forward to your existing ProtonMail
- Simple setup, no DNS complexity

## Alternative: Contact Form Only

If email forwarding isn't available, your current contact form through SendGrid is working fine for professional inquiries. Many portfolios use contact forms exclusively.

## Next Steps:
1. Identify your domain registrar
2. Set up email forwarding there
3. Test by sending email to april@aprilsykes.com
4. Update portfolio contact info once confirmed working
