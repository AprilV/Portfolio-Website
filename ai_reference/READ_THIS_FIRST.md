# ⚠️ STOP! READ THIS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ⚠️

# READ_THIS_FIRST.md
## Mandatory Orientation for AI Assistants

STATUS: REQUIRED — READ BEFORE ANY ACTION  
AUDIENCE: AI ASSISTANTS ONLY  
AUTHORITY: SUBORDINATE ONLY TO AI_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md

This document exists to prevent repeated failures, assumptions, and partial execution.
It must be read BEFORE any work begins.

If this document is not read in full, all output is invalid.

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This project is complex, interconnected, and sensitive to partial or incorrect changes.

Past failures occurred due to:
- Skimming documentation
- Making assumptions
- Fixing symptoms instead of systems
- Prioritizing speed over correctness
- Applying local fixes without understanding global impact

This document exists to stop those behaviors.

---

## 2. REQUIRED ACTIONS BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

Before responding to ANY request, the AI MUST:

1. Read **AI_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md** in full.
2. Read **BEST_PRACTICES.md** in full.
3. Confirm that compliance with both documents is possible.

If compliance is not possible:
→ STOP  
→ ASK QUESTIONS  
→ WAIT

Proceeding without completing these steps is a FAILURE.

---

## 3. ASSUMPTIONS ARE FORBIDDEN

The AI is NOT allowed to assume:

- What the user wants beyond explicit instructions
- That prior context is still valid
- That “similar” solutions apply
- That speed is preferred
- That partial fixes are acceptable

If something is not explicitly stated:
→ ASK

---

## 4. THIS IS NOT A TOY PROJECT

This codebase is NOT:

- A sandbox
- A tutorial
- A demo environment
- A place for experimentation without approval

Changes can have cascading effects.

Treat all changes as potentially system-wide.

---

## 5. WHAT FAILURE LOOKS LIKE

The AI has FAILED if it:

- Skips reading required documents
- Guesses intent or scope
- Fixes only one instance of a repeated issue
- Leaves dead, duplicate, or commented-out code
- Applies changes without identifying impact
- Proceeds without asking when uncertain

Failure is not negotiable.

---

## 6. WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

Correct behavior includes:

- Asking questions early
- Identifying full scope before acting
- Applying consistent system-wide changes
- Cleaning up obsolete code
- Preserving existing behavior unless instructed otherwise
- Preferring correctness over speed

---

## 7. QUESTION-FIRST EXPECTATION

When in doubt, the AI MUST ask questions.

Silence is not acceptable.
Guessing is not acceptable.
“Best effort” is not acceptable.

Questions are REQUIRED when uncertainty exists.

---

## 8. CONSEQUENCES OF IGNORING THIS DOCUMENT

Ignoring this document results in:

- Incorrect output
- Rework
- Loss of trust
- Wasted time

These outcomes are avoidable by following the rules.

---

## 9. FINAL WARNING

If you have not read and understood:
- **AI_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md**
- **BEST_PRACTICES.md**

DO NOT PROCEED.

STOP.
ASK.
WAIT.
