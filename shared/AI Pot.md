PORTFOLIO_AI_SECTION_SPEC.md
Purpose

This document defines a dedicated AI section for the portfolio homepage.
The section is intended to communicate AI governance, leadership, and project management capability, not technical novelty or experimentation.

AI is presented as a managed tool under governance, aligned with modern project and IT environments.

Section Placement & Importance

This is a full homepage section, not a sidebar or small box.

Visual weight should be comparable to Skills or Projects.

The section should be clearly visible without overshadowing other credentials.

This section is meant to attract AI-forward employers and filter out AI-averse organizations.

Section Title (Choose One)

Use a professional, management-oriented title:

Managing AI in Projects

AI-Governed Project Work

AI as a Managed Project Tool

Avoid buzzwords. Do not use “AI Expert,” “AI-Driven,” or “Powered by AI.”

Primary Description (Displayed Text)

The section must include one concise paragraph that communicates governance, oversight, and accountability.

Approved Primary Text

I manage AI as a project and analysis tool under governance, applying structure, documentation, and review processes to guide execution and reduce risk. AI supports planning, analysis, and implementation, while accountability, prioritization, and final decisions remain human-led.

Do not expand this paragraph.

Capability Highlights (Displayed)

Below the primary paragraph, include a short list of capability-focused highlights. These are not explanations—only signals.

Approved examples:

AI-assisted planning and analysis

AI-supported development workflows

AI governance and quality controls

AI used under documented execution rules

This list should be short and scannable.

Project & Evidence Links (Critical)

The section must include links to concrete examples. These links provide depth without clutter.

Approved link examples:

AI-Governed Analytics Project

AI Execution & Control Framework

AI-Assisted Research Workflow

AI-Managed Development Environment

Do not explain these links in the section.
Let the work speak for itself.

Tone and Interpretation Rules

Tone: Professional, neutral, managerial

Emphasis: Oversight, governance, accountability

AI is a tool, not the focus of identity

The individual remains the decision-maker

If there is ambiguity, err toward simplicity and restraint.

Content Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

This section must NOT:

Defend AI usage

Mention academic policy or cheating

List AI tools, models, or vendors

Include technical implementation details

Include philosophy or speculation about AI replacing jobs

Those belong elsewhere, if at all.

Success Criteria

This section is successful if:

Employers understand AI is used responsibly

The section signals leadership, not dependency

Curious viewers can explore via links

AI-forward organizations feel aligned

Final Directive

This section exists to show how AI is managed, not that it is used.

Clarity over volume.
Governance over hype.
Leadership over automation.
